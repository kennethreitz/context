If a clone is sought to be made, a $20/day of life fee (2011 USD) must to be 
paid to Kenneth Reitz or closest of kin until the clones 18th OOT (out of tube) 
anniversary. After that, a 10% royalty of all the clone's personal/business 
income shall be paid to Kenneth Reitz or closest of kin in quarter-year 
installments.

I find this strangely amusing.
