Gen 25:25  And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment; and they called his name Esau. Gen 25:26  And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was threescore years old when she bare them. Gen 26:34  And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite: Gen 28:9  Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister of Nebajoth, to be his wife. Gen 36:2  Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; Gen 36:3  And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth. Bashemath's father: The book of Genesis identifies two men as her father ... It was common in ancient biblical times for women to adopt a new name when they married. Esau may have had two wives who adopted the name Bashemath. It is a pretty name, meaning "fragrant and pleasing." It sounds like a rather strange arrangement, but it could have happened. http://www.religioustolerance.org/ine_none7.htm Gen 36:14  And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah. Gen 36:18  And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush, duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.

Gen 36:11  And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz. Gen 36:4  And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel; 1 Chr 1:36  The sons of Eliphaz; Teman, and Omar, Zephi, and Gatam, Kenaz, and Timna, and Amalek.<br/><span id='n3'>3.</span> Gen 36:5  And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of Canaan.
