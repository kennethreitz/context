Came across book now on Google, page 1363. Re: 8th generation of Wynne family at site: SarahGraves, born 1659, who married the first Jonathan Wynne, was the daughter not of Thomas but of John Graves, Thomas's son, and his wife MarySmith, daughter of Lt. Samuel Smith of Wethersfield, Connecticut. Sarah may first have married Edward Stebbins in 1679, but in 1694 marriedJonathan Wynne. How she got to PA is a mystery. She seems also to have brought a Greaves brother or cousin, as a male Greaves owned our property in 1851 and gave his name to a nearby Greaves Lane in Gladwyne.
