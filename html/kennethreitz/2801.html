Her father, Comfort Starr, died on the 2nd day of January, 1659. His will was probated on the 3rd of February, 1659 and in it he made bequests to the five children of his DECEASED daughter Maynard. Therefore we know that Mary (Starr) MAYNARD was dead by 1659.* The Mary who married John Maynard of Sudbury was still alive in : John Maynard of Sudbury made his will in 1672, referring to his wife Mary who was still alive at that time. This also distinguishes him from John Maynard of Duxbury. Others suggest she may have been Mary, daughter of Edmund Rice for the following reasons:&lt;ref&gt;Eleanor R. Weston, &quot;A probable wife for Thomas Axtell,&quot; in ''Connecticut Nutmegger,'' 31(1998):390-392&lt;/ref&gt;* Edmund had a daughter of the right age about whom nothing further is known* Edmund Rice and the Axtells came from the same parish/town in England (Berkhamstead)* Thomas Axtell, upon landing, purchased land from Rice who had arrived in the New World five years earlier.* Thomas and Mary's children had the same names as Edmunds, and in the same order.* When Thomas Axtel died without a will, Edmund Rice, Philemon Whale &amp; Edward Rice took inventory, implying relationship with Thomas or hiswidow. == Biography == She married first by 1639 Thomas Axtell who died in Sudbury 8 May 1646. (Their first child was bpt 25 Sep 1639) She m2 in Sudbury June 16, 1646  John Maynard, not the same man as heof Duxbury. Mary (_____) Axtell Maynard was still alive in 1673 when her second husband's estate was probated/administered. Children by Thomas Axtell:* Mary Axtell Goodenow (1639 - 1704); m John Goodenow 19 SEp 1656 in Sudbury * Henry Axtell (1641 - 1676); m Hannah Merriam 14 Jun 1665 Marlborough* Lydia Axtell, b 1 Jun 1644 Sudbury; may have been she who m. JosephMoore; called daughter in her step-father's will. But some argue thatshe was not an Axtell but a Maynard.&lt;ref&gt;Neil D.
