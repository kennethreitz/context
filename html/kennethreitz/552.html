[[Category: Hercules of Dover, sailed March, 1634-35]]. == Biography ==. === Relationship to William and Peter Towne ===Either Susanna or her husband [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] was related to [[Towne-494|Peter Towne]] and his father [[Towne-493|William Towne]]. The will of Peter Towne includes a bequest to his &quot;first cousins at Bridgewater&quot; Nathaniel Howard, Joseph Howard, Elisha Howard and Mary Mitchell,&lt;ref name=&quot;PeterWill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR20p370&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; who were children of [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]] and his wife Susanna.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt; Some genealogists seem to have concluded that this means that Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward, was William Towne's sister. Foremost among these was Clarence Almon Torrey.In his 1945 TAG article ''Some Ancestral Lines of President William Howard Taft'', he stated (without sources or discussion) that Thomas Hayward married Susanna Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG22p205&quot;/&gt; In addition, the entry for Thomas Hayward's marriage in Torrey's ''New England Marriagesto 1700'' has Susanna's maiden name of &quot;[Towne]&quot; in brackets but without a question mark, indicating that, although no marriage record had been found, Torrey was confident that her maiden name was Towne. None of the sources listed by Torrey, however, provide any useful evidence for Susanna's last name beyond the language of Peter Towne's will and none, except Torrey's own 1945 TAG article and one source that explicitly relied on it, claim that her maiden name was Towne.&lt;ref name=&quot;Torreys&quot;/&gt; It is unclear why Torrey felt confident that Susanna's maiden name was Towne, as there are three (seemingly equally probable) ways inwhich Thomas and Susanna Hayward's children could have been Peter Towne's cousins:# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne. In that case, Susanna's maiden name would have been Towne and the maiden name of William's wife Martha would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward could have been the sister of William Town's wife Martha. In that case, Martha's maiden name would have been Hayward and the maiden name of Thomas's wife Susanna would be unknown.# Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna could have been the sister of WilliamTowne's wife Martha. In that case, the maiden name of both Susanna and Martha would be unknown.No evidence has been found that favors one of these possibilities over another. Anderson declined to adopt Torrey's theory that the maiden name of Thomas Hayward's wife Susanna was Towne and instead concluded that the relationship between the children of Thomas and Susanna Hayward and Peter Towne has not been determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM7p78&quot;/&gt;. === Maiden Name; Parentage ===Susanna's maiden name is uncertain. As discussed above under &quot;Relationship to William and Peter Towne,&quot; it is quite possible that she was the sister of William Towne and thus her maiden name was Towne. However, it is also quite possible, if not probable, that she was not the sister of William Towne, in which case, there would be no reason to thinkthat her maiden name was Towne and her maiden name is unknown. Even if she was William Towne's sister, her parentage would be unknown, since, as discussed in [[Towne-493|William's profile]], his parentage is unknown. === Origin ===The origin (last residence prior to emigrating to New England) of Susanna, the wife of Thomas Hayward of Duxbury and Bridgewater, was Aylesford, Kent. Her place of origin is established by a record showing theenrollment for passage to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', under a minister's certification dated March 14, 1634/5, of &quot;Thos Hayward ofAylesford in Kent Taylor &amp; Susanna his Wief&quot; and children &quot;Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan, and Martha.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt;. === Date and Place of Birth ===Susanna's date and place of birth are uncertain. Many family trees state that Susanna was born in Aylesford, Kent. Since (as established bythe ''Hercules'' passenger list referenced in &quot;Origin&quot; above) Susannawas living in Aylesford before she emigrated, it is reasonably plausible that she was born there. However, no record of her birth or baptism has been found. If Susanna was born and baptized in Aylesford, it isunlikely that any record of her birth or baptism will ever be found, as no records appear to exist for Aylesford, Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt;. Based on her estimated date of marriage (sometime in 1620-1628), Susanna was probably born sometime in 1595-1610, with &quot;about 1602&quot; as a reasonable midpoint estimate. === Marriage ===Susanna and Thomas Hayward's date and place of marriage are uncertain. Since the ''Hercules'' passenger list establishes that Susanna and Thomas were residents of Aylesford, Kent, it is reasonably likely that they were married there or in a nearby parish. If they were married inAylesford, it is unlikely that any marriage record will ever be found, since, as discussed above, no records appear to exist for Aylesford,Saints Peter and Paul Parish prior to 1654.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aylesford&quot;/&gt;. Based on the fact that the ''Hercules'' passenger list shows that Susanna and Thomas had 5 children as of March 1634/5, and assuming the first child was born 1 year after their marriage and assuming a 2-year gap between births, one derives an estimated marriage date of sometime in 1624-1627. Based on the possibility of miscarriages, still births, children who died young, and longer gaps between births, they could well have been married as early as, say, 1620. Based on the possibility of twins or shorter gaps between births, they could have been married as late as 1628. Anderson estimates that they were married &quot;by about 1624,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; although this suggests that 1624 was the later end of the possible range when, instead, it appears to be a reasonable midpoint. === Emigration to New England ===As discussed above under &quot;Origin,&quot; Susanna, her husband Thomas, and their five eldest children, Thomas, John, Elizabeth, Susan and Martha, emigrated to New England aboard the ''Hercules'', which departed Sandwich, England for New England in March 1634/5.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Boys751&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hottenxix&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt;. === Residency at Cambridge, Duxbury and Bridgewater ===As discussed in the profile for her husband, [[Hayward-270|Thomas Hayward]], Susanna and her family appear to have initially settled in Cambridge in the Massachusetts Bay Colony, moved to Duxbury in the Plymouth Colony by 1638, and finally moved to Bridgewater by 1658. === Children ===. Susanna and Thomas had the following children:# [[Hayward-130|Thomas]], b. in England perhaps about 1624,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. Sarah _______,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; d.s.p. before April17, 1699&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-172|John]], b. in England perhaps about 1626,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. by 1661 Sarah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; Commonly called John of the Plain to distinguish him from John Haward/Howard, the husband of his sister Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell177&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-1132|Elizabeth]], b. in England perhaps about 1628,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; m. October 20, 1645 John Ames,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p291&quot;/&gt; d.s.p. before May 28, 1705&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-352|Susanna]], b. in England perhaps about 1632,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; m. by 1654 John Richmond,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; d. before May 28, 1705 leaving issue&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-769|Martha]], b. in England perhaps about 1634, m. about 1653 John Haward/Howard in Duxbury, d. before September 1703 (see sources in Martha's profile)# [[Hayward-1091|Nathaniel]], b. perhaps about 1639&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; m. by 1664 Hannah Willis,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; d. after May 28, 1705&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-1119|Elisha]], born probably about 1642&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; never married,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; d. by September 22, 1710&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-174|Joseph]], b. perhaps about 1646&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; m. 1st by 1673 Alice Brett,&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; m. 2d by 1682 Hannah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Mitchell says there was an additional wife between AliceBrett and Hannah Mitchell.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell177&quot;/&gt;# [[Hayward-170|Mary]], b. probably about 1648&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; presumably in Duxbury,&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsResidence&quot;/&gt; m. about 1668 Edward Mitchell&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;The 1907 ''Dunham Genealogy'' states, without providing any source orexplanation, that Thomas Hayward also had a daughter named Mehitable,born about 1643, who married [[Dunham-170|Daniel Dunham]] in 1668.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunham300&quot;/&gt; No reliable evidence has been found for any such daughter, however, and Anderson doesn't even mention the theory. A 1954 article in TAG concluded that, contrary to the assertion in ''DunhamGenealogy'', Daniel Dunham's wife was named Hannah and that her maiden name was undetermined.&lt;ref name=&quot;TAG30p146&quot;/&gt;. === Death ===Susanna's date and place of death are uncertain. No record that establishes her death has been found. Based on the fact that she was not mentioned in her husband's will which he made on June 29, 1678,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;/&gt; she presumably died before that date. Since she and her husband were residents of Bridgewater, she presumably died there. &lt;span class=&quot;hidden&quot;&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;PCW4p82&quot;&gt;Plymouth Colony Records, Wills, Vol. 4 1683-1686, Part 1, p 82.

Kent, -- with wife Susanna, and five children.  But he had, perhaps, been here as early as 1632, coming withWinslow, in the William and Francis, and, satisfied with prospects, went home to bring them.  Settled in Duxbury, 1638; probably at Bridgewater, 1651, being of the first proprietors, 1645; was freeman of the colony, 1646.  Had Thomas, Nathaniel, John, Joseph, Elisha, Mary, wife of Edward Mitchell, and Martha, wife of John Howard.  But of these, weare unable to discriminate which were born in England, or whether even he were that Kentish man or not.  He died 1681. == Biography == From History of Bridgewater:Thomas Esq. (son of Thomas Hayward I) was also one of the first settlers of Bridgewater, and by far the most honored and distinguished man in the place; was one of the first military officers; appointed Lieutenant 1667 and Captain 1692; was a Magistrate and one of the Governor'sAssistants, first chosen 1690, and Justice of C.C.P. and Sessions 1692; his death was occasioned by a fall from his horse, 15 Aug. 1698; heleft a wid. Sarah, but no children, he lived near where Daniel Hayward now lives. The first military officers were Josiah Standish, Lieutenant, 1660, who soon after returned to Duxbury; and Thomas Hayward, Jr., Lieutenant; and John Haward, Ensign, appointed 1664.   And in 1689 they were promoted, and Samuel Packard appointed Ensign.—Deacon John Willis was appointed to administer oaths, &amp;c., in 1660, but Capt. Thomas Hayward, Jr., was the first Magistrate in town, and one of the Governor's Council or Assistants 1690, and also a Judge of the courts; he was killed by a fall from his horse, August 15, 1698, while on a journey to Marshfield on business.—Elihu Brett was the next Magistrate, and he was also appointed a Judge of the courts 1700; he died suddenly in his chairJanuary 12th, 1712. Phillips War:   The following is an extract from an ancient manuscript, of which Comfort Willis, who then held the office of &quot;Town Trooper,&quot; is supposedto have been the author:— &quot;On Saturday, Capt. (Thomas) Hayward, Sergeant (Samuel Jr.) Packard, John Willis, and Isaac Harris, went out to see if the Indians were coming down upon them, and they saw an Indian, which made them think the enemy was at hand; and they immediately pressed Comfort Willis and Joseph Edson to go post to the Governor the same day at night to tell him of it.   And he went to Plymouth with them the next day, to send Capt. Church with his company.   And Capt. Church came with them to Monponset on the Sabbath, and came no further that day; and he told them he would meet them the next day.   And Comfort Willis and Joseph Edsoncame home at night and told their friends of it, and Ensign (John) Haward, Samuel Edson, Josiah Edson, Joseph Edson, John Washburn, Samuel Washburn, Thomas Washburn, John Field, Nicholas Byram, Samuel Allen, Samuel Allen, Jr., John Gordon, John Hayward, John Packard, John Ames, Comfort Willis, Guido Bailey, Nathaniel Hayward, John Whitman, John Packard and Samuel Leach went out on Monday, supposing to meet with Captain Church; but they came upon the enemy, and fought with them, and took seventeen of them alive and also much plunder.   And they all returned, and not one of them fell by the enemy, and received no help from Church.&quot; wikipedia:King Philip's War, sometimes called the First Indian War, Metacom's War, Metacomet's War, or Metacom's Rebellion, was an armed conflict between Native American inhabitants of present-day New England and English colonists and their Native American allies in 1675–78. The war is named after the main leader of the Native American side, Metacomet, known to the English as &quot;King Philip&quot;. Major Benjamin Church emerged as the Puritan hero of the war; it was his company of Puritan rangers andNative American allies that finally hunted down and killed King Philip on August 12, 1676. The war continued in northern New England (primarily in Maine at the New England and Acadia border) until a treaty wassigned at Casco Bay in April 1678.The war was the single greatest calamity to occur in seventeenth-century Puritan New England. In the space of little more than a year, twelve of the region's towns were destroyed and many more damaged, the colony's economy was all but ruined, and much of its population was killed, including one-tenth of all men available for military service. Morethan half of New England's towns were attacked by Native American warriors. NY Times:.....King Philip's War (or Metacom's Rebellion, for those who prefer the actual name of the Wampanoag chief). That fearsome and formative confrontation between white settlers and the New England tribes remains, per capita, America's deadliest war. In one year, one of every 10 white men of military age in Massachusetts Bay was killed, and one of every 16 in the Northeastern colonies. Two-thirds of New England towns were attacked and more than half the settlements were left in ruins. Settlers were forced to retreat nearly to the coast, and the Colonial economy was devastated.<br/><span id='n2'>2.</span> [[Category:US President Direct Ancestor]] [[Category: Bridgewater, Massachusetts]] {{Puritan Great Migration|needs=Research|needs1=Biography}} ----'''TAKE CARE...'''

Anderson estimates that she was born &quot;say 1635,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; apparently based on the date he estimated for her parents' marriage and for her siblings' dates of birth. However, since all those dates seem to be rough estimates and the window for her birth in 1635 is very small, it is very possible (if not likely) that Martha wasborn somewhat earlier.  Since the ''Hercules'' passenger lists statesthat Thomas and his family were from Aylesford, England, Martha was very probably born there.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Emigration to New England ===Martha and her family sailed from Sandwich, England to New England in1635 aboard the ship ''Hercules'', John Witherley, master.&lt;ref name=&quot;NEHGR75p219&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hotten&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; They settled first at Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p288&quot;/&gt; === Removal to Duxbury ===Martha's family moved from Cambridge to Duxbury by 1638.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p289&quot;/&gt; === &quot;Vain, Light and Lascivious Carriage&quot; ===At a Grand Inquest on June 8, 1651, Martha Haward of Duxbury, along with John Shaw, James Shaw, Samuel Cutbert and Benjamin Eaton of Plymouth and Goodwife Gannett and William Snow of Duxbury, were presented for &quot;vaine, light and lacivius carriage at an unseasonable time of night.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p170&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; At the General Court at New Plymouth on October 7, 1651, the Court, &quot;not finding them alike faulty, have fined James Shaw and Goodwife Ganett thirty shillings apeace . . . and Samuell Cutbert, William Snow, Benjamine Eaton and Martha Haward are released, with admonishion to take heed of such evell carriages for the future.

However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, Martha and John were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both Thomas Hayward and John Haward/Howard were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably married there. === Children === Martha and John had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.
