This is from papers sent by Sallie D Shultz (Hartranft) (B3, C1, D1, E1)and believed to be a decendent of the above named Mary who married a Jno Smith,to Marriot Brosius,March 21 1900, from Jersey City , where she then lived. These papers were given to me some time since. Sallie further states in her letter than her father &quot;had other papers to prove the claim for the Brosius Fortune, that were sent to George W. Albert (    ) of Hagerstown, Md.  Note:  I typed this  notation exactly as it was written---the wording is puzzeling and leaves one wondering the meaning---Will Brosius  2 181999  www.familysearch.org--revealed a John Abraham Brosius and resulting father-mother charts etc.  I have every reason to believe this isthe same John Abraham-until research proves other wise.
