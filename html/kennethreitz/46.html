He married about 1638 Mary Unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; Axtell family researchers make a good case for why her maiden name was NOT Starr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axtellfamily.org/axgenea/axcheney.html Marilyn Axtell Cheney, &quot;A Myth Put to Rest&quot;] (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;. ::Other sources state he married Mary Rice and that upon landing, purchased land for Mary's kin Edward Rice who arrived in the New World five years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt;. Two children were born to them in England, and their baptism is recorded in St. Peter's, Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt;. In October 1643, Thomas purchased five acres of land in Sudbury, Massachusetts, of Edmond Rice, who came from Berkhamstead also. This land is described as &quot;lying in ye south part of ye town-bounds, the southwest side lying to the commons and joined to the land of Edmond Rice, southward and northward to the highway leading from Sudbury to Mr. Duston's farm.&quot; This area is now in the town of Wayland.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt;. Thomas took the oath of fidelity July 8, 1645&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt;. He died in March, 1646, and was buried the 8th of that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt; Mary, his widow, appears to have married John Maynard, June 16, 1646. He was a widower with a boy of eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt;. After Thomas death, Edmond Rice bought back the land, six acres, and dwelling house near the spring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; /&gt;. The Axtell Genalogy speculates thus: &quot;The story told in those words is short, indeed, but we are permitted to see what it stands for. The young Englishman was a soldier or at least trained to arms; he was of strong puritanical leanings, like his brother Daniel the regicide. Withhis wife and two little ones he followed his neighbor across the sea to make his home in a frontier settlement of New England.

On 20 Jan 1668/9 John Maynard, husbandman, gave bond of 20 pounds forthe appearance of &quot;his daughter Lidiah&quot; to answer to a charge of fornication with Joseph Moore. On 26 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore confessed to fornication with Lydia Maynard and gave bond of 20 pounds for his appearance to answer the charge, with Jacob Moore (his brother) and Henry Rice as sureties. On 28 Jan 1668/9, Joseph Moore was summoned to answer for fornicationwith Lydia Maynard. Lydia married [[Moore-4393|Joseph Moore]] between 28 Jan 1668/9 (whenstill single, charged with fornication with each other, and she was no doubt pregnant) and 14 Apr 1669 when their son Benoni was born (Sudbury vital records); she is most definitely married by 5 Oct 1669 by which time the records refer to her as &quot;Lydia Maynard now Moore&quot;. She died 23 NOV 1717 Sudbury, Middlesex, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;Sudbury Vital Records, Deaths, p 317&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 Oct 1669, petition by Elizabeth Moore, mother of Joseph, and Mary Maynard, mother of Lydia Maynard now Moore, seeking that the imposition of corporeal punishment for fornication on their children be relieved, and a fine imposed instead. The court minutes of the period are missing, so we do not know when the charge was first made, what exactlythe penalty was, or whether the petition of the mothers was respected. &lt;ref&gt;Neil D. Thompson, &quot;Lydia Maynard, Wife of Joseph Moore of Sudbury MA,&quot; in ''The American Genealogist,'' 60(1984):53-55&lt;/ref&gt; === Note ===Note:  (or Mary). The Sudbury Vital Records gives both names on the same date, born June 1, 1644. In his will, John Maynard speaks of his daughter Lydia, wife of John Moore, and as there is no record of any other Lydia in his family, it seems probable that the daughter of his wife by her first husband,Thomas Axtell, is intended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Axtell&quot; &gt;Axtell, Carson A.
