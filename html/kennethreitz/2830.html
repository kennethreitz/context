An April 1714 Middlesex Co probate [citation?] gave the illusion of such a child, but subsequent research revealed this 1714 probate action was for son EDWARD. Somehow this probate involved the estateof the old man Edmund Rice Senior because essentially every one one his offspring had a descendant represented in that probate (see the Ward ca1857 Rice book, the very same book that created the false illusionof a son Edmund). The Edmund Rice (1638) Association estimates that after 13 or 14 generations, descendants of Edmund Rice may be in the many hundreds of thousands to millions. == Sources == &lt;references /&gt; See also: (remove those that are already referenced in footnotes) * Attached Documents.* [http://www.gulbangi.com/genrpts/desctwheeler.pdf  Descendants of Thomas Wheeler (9422)] * ''History of the Town of Marborough,'' Pages 240-247 * ''The American Genealogist,'' 65 (1990): page #s? * Research of [[Adamson-409|J.
