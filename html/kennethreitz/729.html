Please be careful not to merge them! :# John Maynard of Hartford, CT (no children):# John Maynard of Duxbury, MA; m1 Mary, dau of Comfort Starr (she died by 1659); m2 Elizabeth Wight:# John Maynard of Sudbury/ Marlborough; m. Mary _____ (some say Rice); she survived him (he died in 1672). ==Biography== ==NOTE Jan, 2015==John Maynard II, the first immigrant ancestor, settled in Sudbury (now Wayland) and was one of the forty-seven who shared the meadow along the Sudbury River. His house lot of four acres was near those of Edmond and Henry Rice on North Street. At first, he built a low loghouse probably with a thatched roof and later a frame house. John was evidently desirous to locate in a fertile spot where cattle could be fed and ahome maintained. John was admitted a freeman on May 20,1644 and was select man of Sudbury in 1646. John II's first wife was Judith Starr. When she died in 1642, John later remarried her sister, Mary in 1645. In early records and histories, there are several conflicting accounts of John Maynard. There are claims of two men of the same name in the area and one account of them being married to the same Mary Starr. Most account have the familes of John II and John III confused. I believe that John of Sudbury can be proven and that the account of another event settles the John II/ John III confusion. In 1660, the inhabitants of Sudbury petitioned the General Court, stating that as the Lord had blessed them with very large families and had also greatly prospered them by increasing their flocksand herds, they found themselves much hampered for room for their cattle to feed. On May 31, 1660, a grant of six square miles was set off for their needs and this country was known as Whippin and afterwards in corporated as Marlborough. In this grant, John Maynard II was assigned a good area in the central part of the present city of Marlborough.John III went to this grant and settled, and married Mary Gates. In his father's will, he stated that he had already deeded this property to John III. Thus all the descentants by the name of Maynard in Marlborough, Southboro, Westborough and Shewsbury come from John III, while most of the families in Framingham and various parts of Sudbury and Wayland come from John, the II. John Maynard died in Sudbury on December 10, 1672. His will was datedSeptember 4, 1672 and proved April 1, 1673. In it are mentioned his eldest son John Maynard, son Zachery, wife Mary, daughter Elisabeth wife of Joseph Graves, daughter Lydia wife to Joseph Moore, and youngest daughter Mary, not yet married. His wife Mary and son Zachery were named joint executors. &quot;My trusty friends Deacon John Haines, and Joseph Noys both of Sudbury&quot; were to be supervisors to assist the executors. The will was witnessed by Henry Locker and John Toll.[5] The inventoryof the estate was taken December 30, 1672 by Edmund Goodenow, John Haines, and Joseph Noyes and came to 263 pounds.
