John Hayward of Bridgewater]], who was the brother-in-law of this profile's Lt. JohnHaward of Bridgewater.''' == Biography == === Name ===Original records for this profile's John Howard of Bridgewater consistently spell his name as &quot;Haward,&quot; with a few exceptions that spell his name &quot;Heyward,&quot; &quot;Hayward&quot; or &quot;Heward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; No original record has been found that spells his name &quot;Howard&quot; during his lifetime, although Mitchell assures us that that is how his name was pronounced.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; He was often referred to in the original records by his military title of &quot;Ensign&quot; subsequent to his appointment to that position in 1664 and as &quot;Lieutenant&quot; subsequent to his promotion to that position in 1689.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; He was also sometimes referred to in the original records as John Haward Senior in order to distinguish him from hisyounger brother-in-law, John Hayward/Haward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; (&quot;Senior&quot; was not needed to distinguish him from his son John at the timeSenior was used in the records, as his son was still quite young at the time of those records.) === Earliest Plymouth Records === The earliest Plymouth Colony records of a John Haward/Heyward are:* A June 7, 1637 list of names of soldiers willing to to assist the colonies of Massachusetts Bay and Connecticut in their wars against thePequin Indians, which includes the name &quot;John Heyward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR1p61&quot;/&gt;* A record of a grant at a Plymouth town meeting on October 17, 1642 to &quot;John Heyward&quot; of a garden place next Andrew Ringe and 10 acres of upland at Fresh Lake by the fishing point.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR2p48&quot;/&gt;Curiously, none of the secondary sources for this profile's John Haward/Heyward mention those records. The first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward mentioned in secondary sources is a 1643 list of names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms, which includes the name &quot;John Heyward.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; There is some evidence that there might have been two John Heywards in the Plymouth Colony. The same 1643 list of names of males aged 16-60able to bear arms includes two John Heywards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p188&quot;/&gt; and one in Duxbury. In addition, the 1657 record of mentaking the oath of fidelity in the Plymouth Colony includes two John Hawards: one in Plymouth&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p181&quot;/&gt; and one in Bridgewater.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p185&quot;/&gt; Assuming that the same person was not listed intwo towns, it thus seems likely that there was a John Heyward/Haward of Plymouth and a John Heyward/Haward of Duxbury/Bridgewater and that the 1637 and 1642 Plymouth Colony records for John Heyward relate to the former. === Parentage; Date and Place of Birth ===John's parentage is unknown, except perhaps for the first name of hismother. The &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; contains a copy of a letter dated August 16, 1652 by a Mary Hayward in London to her son John Hayward in NewEngland that was in the possession of a member of the Howard family and was supposedly written to this profile's John Haward/Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; (An image purportedly of the original letter is attached to this profile.) Assuming that letter is authentic and relates to this profile's John Haward/Hayward, his mother's name was Mary and she was living in London in 1652. Some family trees say that John was the son of a James Howard/Haward and a Mary Cooper, but no reliable evidence for that parentage has been found. John's date of birth is uncertain. Assuming that the secondary sources are correct and that the first record of this profile's John Haward/Heyward is the 1643 list of males of Duxborrow 16-60 years old able tobear arms (and not the earlier Plymouth records for a &quot;John Heyward&quot;), John was probably born sometime in 1623-1627 based on (i) the fact that his inclusion in the 1643 list means that he was at least 16 in 1643 and thus born no later than 1627 and (ii) the fact that the earliest estimated date of birth of one of his children (1653) suggests that he was probably not older than 30 years old at that date and thus was probably born no earlier than 1623. If, on the other hand, the 1637 record for &quot;John Heyward&quot; relates to this profiles John Haward/Heyward, he was probably born no later than 1621 (since, to volunteer for military service, he probably needed to be at least 16 years old). John's place of birth is also uncertain. It is very likely that he was born in England.  Some family trees say that John was born in Sandwich, Kent, but no reliable evidence supporting that proposition has been found. Assuming the letter referred to above is authentic and relates to this profile's John Howard, it is quite possible that he was bornin London, since his mother was living there in 1652. === Immigration to New England ===John Haward's date of immigration is uncertain and his means of immigration are unknown. Based on the assumption that John was the &quot;John Heyward&quot; included in a 1643 list of men of Duxbury, Plymouth Colony 16-60 years old able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; he immigrated sometime before that date. === Age at Immigration; Brought up by Miles Standish? ===Based on John's estimated date of birth (1623-1627), John was still aminor when he immigrated. This is consistent with &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; which states that John &quot;was young when he came over,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; and with  the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot;, which states (without support) that John was about 15 when he immigrated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Secondary sources suggest that John arrived without his parents and lived, for a time, with Miles Standish, who resided in Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; &quot;it is said, [that John] lived in Capt. Miles Standish's family,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; while Savage (writing after Mitchell) stated that John was &quot;one of the first sett. brot. up by Capt. Miles Standish.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt; === Brother James or George? ===According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater,&quot; John immigrated with a brother named James, who subsequently moved to Bermuda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; however, states that he immigrated with a brother named George.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; The source for &quot;George&quot; in the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; appears to be the letter referenced above by Mary Hayward to John Hayward in New England, which also references her son George Hayward and niece Sarah, also in New England.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxvi&quot;/&gt; Some additional support for the proposition that John had a brother named George is provided by the fact that a &quot;Gorg Haward&quot; took the oath of fidelity in Barnstable, PlymouthColony in 1657,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p179&quot;/&gt; the same year that John took the oath in Bridgewater. If, as the evidence suggests, John and his brother James/George immigrated as teenagers without their parents, they may well have ended up in the care of different families, which would help explain why Georgeended up settling in Barnstable, while John settled in Duxbury and Bridgewater. ===  Residency in Duxbury; Removal to Bridgewater ===Based on the inclusion of the name of &quot;John Heyward&quot; in the 1643 listof names of males in Duxbury aged 16-60 able to bear arms,&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR8p190&quot;/&gt; John was living in Duxbury at that date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The town of Bridgewater started as a grant of additional land to the inhabitants of Duxbury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell9-13&quot;/&gt; John Haward was one of the original proprietors of the Duxborrow new plantation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell10-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; which supports the proposition that John Haward of Bridgewater was the same person as John Heyward of Duxbury. According to &quot;History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater&quot;and the &quot;Howard Genealogy,&quot; John moved to what would become Bridgewater about 1651.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; The Duxborrow new plantationwas incorporated as the town of Bridgewater in 1656.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCR3p101&quot;/&gt; === Marriage ===John married [[Hayward-769|Martha Hayward]], daughter of Thomas Hayward.&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard1&quot;/&gt; Her first name is confirmed by records of the division of his estate, which refer to his widow Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; Her identity as a daughter of Thomas Hayward is confirmed by a quitclaim by John's children of rights to property bequeathed by Peter Town to Thomas Hayward's children.&lt;ref name=&quot;MiddlesexDeeds23p398&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p293&quot;/&gt; Some family trees state that John and Martha were married on April 6,1657 in Dennis, Barnstable County. However, both the date and location seem very improbable, and no reliable sources supporting either thatdate or location have been found. Based on the estimated dates of birth of their children, John and Martha were probably married sometime in 1652-1655. Consistent with this range, Anderson states that they were married &quot;by about 1655.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GM3p292&quot;/&gt; Since both John and Thomas Hayward were residents of Duxbury during that time period (and Bridgewater was not incorporated until 1656), they were probably marriedthere. === Children === John and Martha had the following children:# [[Howard-704|John]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1653-7 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1678 Sara Latham,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard6&quot;/&gt; d. 1727 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-8985|Elizabeth]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1654-8 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1676 Edward Fobes&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-6598|Sarah]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1657-61 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1679 Zaccheus Packard&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-899|James]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1660-4 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1685 Elizabeth Washburn,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. 1690 on the Canada Expedition&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-994|Jonathan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; b. probably sometime in 1664-8 in Bridgewater,&lt;ref name=&quot;BasedOnMarriage&quot;/&gt; m. 1st January 8, 1688/9 Susanna Keith in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; m. 2d October 8, 1691 Sarah Dean in Taunton,&lt;ref name=&quot;TauntonVR2p241&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt; d. in or before 1739 (date estate divided)&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard7&quot;/&gt;# [[Howard-991|Ephraim]], b. 1667 in Bridgewater, m. about 1688/9 Mary Keith in Bridgewater, d.

April 30, 1755 in Bridgewater&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard5&quot;/&gt;John's parentage of all of the above children (and the identity his daughter's spouses) is established by the records of the division of the property of his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3-4&quot;/&gt; === Public Life ===According to Savage and the &quot;Howard Genealogy&quot; (which may have reliedon Savage), John was a carpenter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Savage2p471&quot;/&gt; By 1670 (or at least 1672), however, he was running an &quot;ordinary&quot; or tavern,&lt;refname=&quot;PCR5p105&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxv&quot;/&gt; either in lieu of, or supplemental to, his carpentry trade. John was selected for a number of public offices by the town of Bridgewater, including as a surveyor of the highways in 1657 and 1671,  a selectman of the town of Bridgewater in 1678 and 1690, and a deputy to the Plymouth General Court in 1678 and 1683.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was also a leading officer in the Bridgewater town militia. He was appointed as Ensign of the militia in 1664.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; In1676, during King Phillip's War, he led a force of 21 townsmen, whichcame upon the enemy, fought with them, and took seventeen of them alive and also much plunder.&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; John was promoted to Lieutenant of the town militia in 1689&lt;ref name=&quot;Records&quot;/&gt; and was referred to as Lieut. John Haward in the records relating to his estate.&lt;ref&gt;See sources cited with respect to the administration and distribution of his estate in &quot;Death; Estate&quot; in this profile.&lt;/ref&gt; === Death; Estate ===NEHGR's 1911 ''Vital Records of Brockton'' states that John died in 1700, based on a gravestone record at North End and Ashland Cemetery.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrocktonVR336&quot;/&gt; The 1903 ''Howard Genealogy'' also states that he died in 1700, but provides no source&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard2&quot;/&gt; other than perhaps a plaque installed by his descendants on the Bridgewater Historical Society Building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howardxv&quot;/&gt; Mitchell, in his 1840 ''History of the Early Settlement of Bridgewater'' apparently foundno record that established the year of his death and simply stated that he died &quot;about 1700.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mitchell191-2&quot;/&gt; It appears reasonably likely that John actually died sometime in 1701rather than in 1700. The inventory of his estate was taken by Thomas Snell, Edward Mitchell and Joseph Hayward on September 24, 1701.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; Since it was customary for the inventory to be taken within a month or so after the deceased's death, the date of his estate inventory suggests that John died in 1701. The inventory of John's estate included his house and homelands, about 400 additional acres of land, two servants, and over £112 owed to him in debts. The estate totaled more than £661, which was a very substantial sum for that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt; John died intestate.&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3&quot;/&gt; On October 16, 1701, Letters of Administration were granted to MarthaHaward (his widow) and John Haward (his eldest son),&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; they made oath as to the inventory,&lt;ref name=&quot;EstatePapers&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; and they agreed to adivision of the estate with his heirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; The division of the estate made allocations to: his widow Martha; eldest son John Haward; second surviving son Jonathan Haward; youngest son Ephraim Haward; James Haward, the only son of deceasedson James Haward, and his two sisters; Edward Fobes and his wife Elizabeth; Zacheus Packard and his wife Sarah; and Henry Kingman and his wife Bethiah. The agreement was signed by all the heirs, except that Edward Mitchell, as guardian for the children of James Haward, signed ontheir behalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howard3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MD49p156-7&quot;/&gt; == Records ==* 1643.
