He was naturalized in Lancaster County on 8 March 1742. He lived on a tract of land known as the &quot;Manor of Adulhea&quot; which was part of the Tulpehocken Settlement of what would become Berks County. He was an original member of the Christ's Tulpehocken Church. Johannnes George had two known sons, Sebastian and Johannes Nicholas, both of whom eventually settled in Northumberland County, PA (in the section known as the Mahantonga Valley). :: Submitted by: Dave Becker Email address: benhur@pond.com &lt;mailto:benhur@pond.com&gt; Address: 1821 North Hills Dr. Apt. # 30 Norristown, PA 19401 :: Neuhar Chronicle Vol. III, ad 1984 by Dennis Kastens, 411 Chapel Dr., Collinsville : 1.62234 :: Johan George Brosius qualified at Philadelphia 27 Sep 1740, having arrived on the ship &quot;Lydie&quot;, his age given as 42, therefore born 1697/8 while not listed we know that at least two teenage sons and at leastone daughter came with him (PA. German Pioneers, list 90). There may have been other children and a wife but we're not sure. (the first time one is mentioned is second wife.) Not long after arrival, The GeorgeBrosius family are found settled as farmers on a 205 acre tract, located on the north east branch of Swatara Creek in Tulpehocken Twp., Lancaster Co., Pa. This became part of the new Berks Co. in 1752. George received his patent on 5 Dec 1750, Paten Bk A, Vol 14, Pg 533, land office, Harrisburg, Pa. on 12 May 1743, he signed and agreement in support of the new Christ Lutheran Church near Stouchburg. He appears on the Tulpehocken Tax List 1754 &amp; 1755 with &quot;two married sons.&quot; (from 1762, John George Brosius and wife Catharine convey their tract of 205 acres to (son) Sebastian Brosius, consideration 150 pounds. (They confirmthe deed 6 Aug 1764). This was considerable below the actual value, and we can be sure there was a separate agreement to support George &amp; Catharine for the balance of their lives, and for legacy payments to the other children. George &amp; Catherine are probably deceased, intestate,by 1773 when Sebastian Brosius family moved to Northumberland Co., and certainly deceased by 17 Apr 1774, when the homestead was conveyed by Sebastin &amp; wife, Margaretha (Roth) to Thomas Kurr, consideration 720pounds. (Kurr probably in possession by 1773). (Berks Co., Deed Bk 12Pg 465). :: We now know that the birth of Johan George Brosius was 31 Jan 1694,as recorded at the Lutheran Church, Weierbach, Rhineland, Germany. Hewas christened Feb 10, 1694 in Weierbach. He married 31 Oct 1724, at Weier- Bach, to Anna Catharina Simon, widow of Abraham Schneider, daughter of Hanns Adam Simon and Anna Catharine Stilgenbauer. (Salt Lake film # 493273 HerrenSulzbach &amp; 489840 Weierbach).

All these children baptized at HerrenSulzbach. George Daniel is listed on the ships list after John George Brosius. :: He was naturalized on March 8, 1742 in Lancaster, PA. Berks was notformed until 1752. George was one of the original members of the Christ Tulpehocken church. His name was on the first list, for the years of 1742-46. The family settled in the area known as &quot;The Manor of Adulhea&quot;, granted to Richard Penn. The &quot;Manor&quot; was part of the Tulpehocken settlement of what would become Berks Co. A Land grant of 205 acres was patented to Hans George Brosius, dated Dec 5, 1750. This property lay east of the present village of Rehrersburg, Tulpehocken Twp. adjoining the Altalaha Church property. The neighboring township of Bethel was to the north of the base of the Blue Mountains. :: The Tulpehocken tax lists of 1752-56 included the names of George Brosius and two married sons. In 1764, George and wife Catherine deededtheir property in Tulpehocken Twp. to Sebastian Brosius. In 1765, Sebastian Brosius, and uxor, deeded 60 square rod of this property to theGerman Lutheran Congregation of Altalaha.
